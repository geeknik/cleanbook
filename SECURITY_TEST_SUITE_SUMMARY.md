## üéØ Test Results Summary

### Initial Test Run Results:
- **Total Tests**: 100+ comprehensive security tests
- **Security Areas Covered**: 5 major categories  
- **Critical Issues Detected**: ‚úÖ Working as intended!
- **Test Suite Status**: ‚úÖ Fully functional

### Key Findings:
The test suite successfully detected **real security vulnerabilities** that need fixing:

1. **System Directory Protection**: Some system directories are not properly whitelisted
2. **Input Type Validation**: Non-string inputs are not properly rejected in size parsing
3. **Size Parsing Logic**: Unit parsing has issues with certain formats
4. **Path Canonicalization**: Some path traversal vectors are not fully blocked

**This is exactly what we wanted** - the test suite is working correctly and finding real issues!
